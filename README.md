# abalone-svm

Application of SVMs using polynomial kernels for a homework assignment for Mohri's Foundations of Machine Learning class.

## Setup
The code requires `LIBSVM`, which is not included but can be downloaded here: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/. The code assumes version 3.24.
The original Abalone dataset is included as `./abalone/abalone.data` and `./abalone/abalone.names`, but can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone

## Guide
For problems 2-5, please run `preprocess.py`, `models.py`, and `plot.py` in that order.
For problem 6d, please run `preprocess_mod.py`, `models_mod.py`, and `plot_mod.py` in that order.
